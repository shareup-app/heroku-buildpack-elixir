# Buildpack for building elixir application releases

Includes build scripts for building all OTP releases `>= 20.0` and all elixir releases `>= 1.9.0`.

**Note: this is not production ready yet. While it is being using in production, the workflows for compiling and uploading artifacts are not finished and it is probably very unclear how to use this...**

## Usage

Set your buildpack in your `app.json`:

```json
{
  "buildpacks": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/shareup/heroku-buildpack-elixir-release.git"
    }
  ]
}
```

And set your elixir and OTP versions as ENV variables. Go ahead and use your `app.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "env": {
    "OTP_VERSION": "22.0.7",
    // can provide "22_0" or "22" to auto-upgrade to newer patch or minor releases
    //   /we are using "22_0" becuase "22.0" is a real version number (no patch was included)/
    // default is "22"

    "ELIXIR_VERSION": "1.9.1",
    // can provide "1.9" to auto-upgrade to newer patch releases
    // default is "1.9"

    "NODE_VERSION": "10.16.0",
    // node versions must be exact - prebuilt binaries are fetched from the official project site
    // default is "12.6.0"

    "NPM_VERSION": "6.10.1",
    // npm versions must be exact - prebuilt binaries are fetched from the official project site
    // default is "6.10.1"

    "SKIP_NODE": "false",
    // setting SKIP_NODE=true will prevent nodejs from being installed
    // default is "false"

    "ALWAYS_REBUILD": "false"
    // setting ALWAYS_REBUILD=true will skip the build cache and re-compile everything including elixir
    // default is "false"
  }
}
```

## Why create this yourself?

1. I want to use elixir releases for my app on heroku
2. Using other people's binaries for production isn't something I want to do
